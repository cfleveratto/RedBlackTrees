Good test cases.

Program does not print out the data in the parent node.

In makeTree, you are using a side-effect of the >> operator
    while (inFile >> readInt) {
      tree.insert(readInt);
    }
Explicitly use eof instead.

In traversePre you have
    if (currNode != NULL) {
      cout << "This Nodes Data:\n";
      cout << currNode->getData() << endl;
      cout << "This Nodes Colouring:\n"
	   << currNode->getColour() << endl;
Instead have an overloaded operator in the Node class and use
      cout << currNode;

You were also supposed to print the height of the subtree at each
node, and the balance factor at each node. You are not storing the
height in the node, nor are you computing it anywhere.

Good comments and pre/post conditions.

Good program structure.
